for missing program pieces that are needed for verifying a property of interest, and
presents these specifications to a human auditor for validation. We have implemented
this framework for a taint analysis of Android apps that relies on specifications
for Android library methods. In an extensive experimental study on 179 apps, our tool
performs verification with only a small number of queries to a human auditor.},
